<h3> pls halp </h3>

<p> I've got this weather code edited for US915, copy pasted EUI/KEYs from helium console. Compiles fine, green light on RAK board blinks during flashing, but device won't communicate with Helium. Any halp greatly appreciated.</p>
</br>
<p> Planning on building a few sensors that are all baby related, got a little girl otw. </p>
</br>
<h2> The ideas </h2>
<p> 2 different projects, the first, car seat safety: I've built a pair of sensors for the car, one for the driver seat one for a car seat, still in need of being programmed = If driver seat empty while baby seat occupied, push notifications sent to phone. (tteague began to help me with that but I haven't started writing that code.) </p>
</br>
<p> The second, enviro sensor for the stroller. So I wanted to start with the 'easy one', but I'm having trouble. I've made a few of these weather monitors before with good luck but hitting a wall here. (If too hot or too cold, push notification sent) </p>
<p> simple stuff i think but i'm stuck. i used this code on arduino before and it worked but I'm trying to migrate to VSC and trying to figure out what it is I'm missing here. thanks for any help folks.  <pp>
